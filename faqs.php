                                            <p>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is a medical treatment in which the
                                                patient is entirely enclosed in a pressure chamber breathing 100% pure
                                                oxygen (O2) at greater than one-atmosphere pressure. Air contains nearly
                                                21% oxygen and approximately 78% nitrogen. In hyperbaric oxygen therapy
                                                (HBO), the oxygen percentage breathed by the patient is nearly or
                                                actually 100%, almost five times more than in air. The pressure of the
                                                oxygen breathed by the patient in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber is usually
                                                more than 1.5 times (and can be as much as 3 times) greater than
                                                atmospheric pressure. HBOT can deliver nearly 15 times as much oxygen as
                                                there is in the air at normal pressure.

                                                into the blood plasma, which is then delivered to the tissues. Breathing

                                                as much physically dissolved oxygen to tissues. This can increase the

                                                pressurized with 100% oxygen. The patient receives 100% oxygen by
                                                breathing the oxygen inside the chamber. A mask or a hood is not needed.

                                                equipment can be treated in the Prana monoplane. (Other monoplane

                                            <p>The timeline for experiencing results from Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy
                                                (HBOT) can vary
                                                depending on the individual and the condition being treated. However,
                                                here are some general
                                                guidelines:
                                            </p>
                                            <ol type="1">
                                                <li><strong>Immediate Effects:</strong> Some individuals report feeling
                                                    more energized or less fatigued immediately after a session,
                                                    although this is not always the case for everyone. This can be
                                                    especially true for people undergoing HBOT for conditions like
                                                    fatigue or muscle recovery.</li>

                                                <li><strong>Short-Term Benefits (A Few Sessions):</strong> For
                                                    conditions such as sports injuries, wounds, or soft tissue damage,
                                                    individuals may start to notice improvements after a few sessions
                                                    (often 5–10 treatments). Common improvements include reduced
                                                    swelling, faster healing, and reduced pain or inflammation.</li>

                                                <li><strong>Long-Term Benefits (Multiple Sessions):</strong> For more
                                                    chronic conditions, like neurological issues, anti-aging benefits,
                                                    or chronic pain, it may take several weeks of regular HBOT sessions
                                                    (often 20–40) to experience noticeable results. These benefits may
                                                    include improved cognitive function, reduced chronic pain, and
                                                    enhanced overall healing or skin regeneration.</li>

                                                <li><strong>Specific Conditions:</strong> The timeline can also depend
                                                    on the specific condition being treated.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>For example:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li> Acute Conditions (e.g., injuries, infections): Often see faster
                                                    recovery, with benefits
                                                    noticeable within a few sessions.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Chronic Conditions (e.g., brain injuries, stroke recovery): The
                                                    benefits may take longer
                                                    to become apparent, requiring ongoing treatment over weeks or even
                                                    months.
                                                    In general, HBOT is cumulative, meaning its effects build over time.
                                                    The frequency of sessions
                                                    and the individual’s response will influence how quickly results can
                                                    be seen. It's always
                                                    recommended to follow the guidance of a healthcare professional for
                                                    the best outcome.
                                                    If you’re considering HBOT, it’s important to have a clear treatment
                                                    plan and expectations set
                                                    with a qualified provider based on your specific health needs.
